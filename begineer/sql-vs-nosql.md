# SQL vs NoSQL

## üìå What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, also known as **relational databases**, store data in tables with predefined schemas. They use structured query language (SQL) to retrieve and manipulate data.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics of SQL Databases:
- Structured data with fixed schemas (tables, columns, rows)
- Strong consistency and ACID compliance
- Uses SQL for queries
- Vertical scalability (scaling by increasing hardware power)
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server

---

## üìå What is NoSQL?
NoSQL databases are designed to handle **unstructured or semi-structured** data. They use various data storage models, including document, key-value, column-family, and graph storage.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics of NoSQL Databases:
- Flexible schema (JSON, key-value, graph, or column-family structures)
- High scalability (horizontal scaling by adding more servers)
- Supports distributed and high-availability applications
- Various query languages (MongoDB uses JSON-like queries)
- Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB

## üîç Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL

| Feature         | SQL (Relational)   | NoSQL (Non-Relational) |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Schema       | Fixed (Predefined tables) | Flexible (Dynamic documents) |
| Scalability  | Vertical Scaling | Horizontal Scaling |
| Query Language | SQL | Varies (MongoDB uses JSON-based queries) |
| Data Storage  | Tables (Rows & Columns) | JSON, Key-Value, Graph, Column-Family |
| Transactions | Strong ACID Compliance | Eventual Consistency |
| Use Cases   | Banking, ERP, CRM | Big Data, Real-time Analytics, IoT |

## üåç When to Use SQL vs NoSQL?

| Use Case | Best Choice |
|---------|------------|
| Structured data with relationships | SQL |
| Large-scale distributed applications | NoSQL |
| Complex queries with joins | SQL |
| Rapid, high-velocity data ingestion | NoSQL |
| High availability and scalability | NoSQL |
| Strict consistency and transactions | SQL |
